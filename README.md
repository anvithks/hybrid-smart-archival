Hybrid Smart Archival of Data across on prem, cloud and edge


Why Smart Data Archival?

Background: 

* Data migration/archival is an important feature in the data management area, where multiple on prem, cloud or edge storages are there.
This feature is already supported by a SODAFOUNDATION project called [multi-cloud](https://github.com/sodafoundation/multi-cloud). 
They implement it by creating some configured-rules and schedulers. So the scheduler keeps watching the rules and acts upons that.
Now, the problem is, rules are static and the system acts upon that only. But in some scenarios, users may need dynamic changes which support their business.

* So, there is a need of adding a logic of smart monitoring the behaviour of the system and acting upon that. That's the main use case of the Smart-data-archival project..
